# Microservice

<h3>Technologies used: Spring Web, Data JPA, OpenFeign, Eureka, Postman</h3>

My goal with this project was to implement what I had already studied only theoretically. With it, I could really understand how microservices can communicate with eachother. In this case, using synchronous communication, using OpenFeign through HTTP requests.
